# tic-tac-toe
<h1>🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game</h1>
A simple Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates the core concepts of front-end web development and JavaScript logic building.

<h3>🚀 How to Play</h3>
1.Click Start Game to begin.
2.The first turn always starts with X.
3.Players take turns marking spaces on the board with X and O.
4.The game continues until one of the players achieves a winning pattern (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
5.If all spaces are filled and no winner is found, the game ends in a Draw.

<h3>📂 Features</h3>

=> Interactive game board.
=> Turn-based system (X → O → X ...).
=> Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals.
=> Draw detection if no winner exists.
=> Restart option to play again.

<h3>🛠️ Technologies Used</h3>
<b>HTML5</b> – for game structure.
<b>CSS3</b> – for styling the board and layout.
<b>JavaScript</b> (ES6) – for game logic and interactivity.

<h3>📘 JavaScript Concepts Covered</h3>
This project helps in understanding and practicing the following JavaScript concepts:

<b>Variables</b> (let, const) – to store player turns, board states, etc.
<b>Functions – for</b> modular code (checking wins, handling turns, resetting game).
<b>Conditional Statements</b> (if-else) – to check game rules (win, draw, valid move).
<b>Loops</b> (for, forEach) – to iterate over cells and check patterns.
<b>Arrays</b> – for storing and managing the board state.
<b>Event Listeners</b> (addEventListener) – to detect user clicks on the game board.
<b>DOM Manipulation</b> – updating UI dynamically (placing X/O, showing winner/draw).
<b>Template Literals</b> – for displaying messages dynamically.
<b>Boolean Logic</b> – switching turns between players.
